Summary of Patterns Covered
Fixed-size sliding window: Problems like "Maximum Average Subarray I" where you are given a fixed window size and need to calculate something (e.g., sum, average, max) within that window.
Dynamic sliding window: Problems like "Minimum Size Subarray Sum" where the window size changes based on the conditions and you need to adjust the window to meet these conditions.
Character counting in sliding window: Problems like "Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters" and "Permutation in String" where you need to keep track of the frequency of characters within the window.
Maximum/minimum within sliding window: Problems like "Sliding Window Maximum" where you need to find the maximum (or minimum) value within each window.
